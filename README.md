# sql-challenge
This is the Repository for the sql challenge: Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

In this project we have 3 files and 1 folder.

On the folder we have 6 .csv files containing the necessary data to do the corresponding analysis.

Of the 3 files 1 is a ERD.png, this is the ERD diagram for the 6 .csv files.

The other 2 files are .sql files: 
1. schema_creator.sql 
    - Contains the script to create the conection structure between the 6 .csv files.

2. query_script.sql
    - Contains the data retrieval information.

This is also the order to run this files  as the schema_creator.sql file is used to create the neccesary tables and connections to be able to run query_script.sql.
